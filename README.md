# Project Name

Feedback Form

## Description

I built a feedback form on a single page application using a hash router. There are four pages of questions - feeling, understanding, support, and comments. Before submitting, users can review the information they put in and go back and change their answers. The first three pages require an input, but the comments are optional. After submitting, the answers are saved in a database.

## Prerequisites

Node.js
React
Redux
Postgresql
Express
Axios
pg
React-Redux
Sweetalert
Material-UI

## Installation

1. Create a database named `prime_feedback`.
2. The queries in the `data.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. I recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries.
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
